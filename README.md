### SlashBot
---
A chatbot for Discord
A chatbot currently focusing on bringing as much information about your games as possible to Discord.

#### Setting up
* Install Python 3.5
* Clone the repository
* Set the paths to your credentials files (JSON) in `slash_bot/config.py`
* Open a terminal or command prompt and `cd` into the cloned repository
* `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
* On macOS or Linux `$ ./run.sh`
* On Windows `> cd slash_bot && python core.py && cd ..`

*The Discord credentials are mandatory, other required credentials depend on your activated modules.*

Example discord.json credentials file:
```json
{
  "token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "client_id":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "bot_id":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "owner_id":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "server_id":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "log_channel_id":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "invite_link": "https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<your_client_id>&scope=bot"
}
```

The `token` value is mandatory. The remaining values are optional and are currently not used anywhere. The `server_id` refers to the bot's server, if it has one. `log_channel_id` will eventually be used for optional information and status logging to a Discord text channel.

Example rito.json credentials file:
```json
{
    "api_key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

### Commands

The bot uses the prefix `,` for all commands. If a module has listed a module prefix, the command syntax will be `,<module_prefix> <command> <parameters>`. For example, the command for League of Legends summoner information would be `,lol summoner Faker KR`. This prefix can be changed in `slash_bot/config.py`. If no module prefix is listed, simply use the command with the prefix as `,<command> <parameters>`. The parameters column lists acceptable combinations of parameters that can be given for a command. Any Discord permissions the bot may need for a command are mentioned in the description.

SlashBot isn't meant to be a public bot because some APIs impose limits which make it unfeasible for use in a larger number of servers with many users. For best results you should host your own instance for use in your server.
